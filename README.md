SineRider is a game about love and graphing, built by teenagers at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) and slated for release in Fall of 2022.

## In a Time Long Ago…

SineRider began its life as a Unity web game in 2014. At the time it looked like this:

The game made a minor splash, at least in the small puddle where the math games swim. In 2015 it was shown at GDC's Experimental Gameplay Workshop:

After that it was [covered by Rock Paper Shotgun](https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sinerider-wants-you-to-love-maths-and-scares-me), and recommended by James Portnow of Extra Credits:

Unfortunately, SineRider disappeared from the internet shortly after release. Every major browser deprecated the NPAPI plugin structure, killing the Unity Web Player and SineRider with it. SineRider ran feral through the internet until this summer, when it was sighted by a roving gang of student hackers, ensnared in a lasso of fiendish construction, brought to heel, taught manners, groomed, and presented for your enjoyment:

## But Why?

Educational games go back a long way. Monopoly began as a parable about the dangers of unregulated capitalism. For thousands of years, Go has been used to convey deep truths about everything from military conquest to flood control. So as as humanity discovered the utility of computers for gaming in the mid-20th century, so too emerged bold claims about the educational potential of this new interactive frontier.

The thesis of educational gaming is clear and convincing:
  A) Education occurs through instruction and practice
  B) Video Games are natural vessels for instruction and practice
  C) Therefore, Video Games are natural vessels for Education

We hold the premises of this basic syllogism to be self-evident. And yet, The Oregon Trail remains as the quintessential educational video game for most of us in 2022. This raises a troubling question: why is a game first released in 1971—a year before Pong—still the archetype for an idea that was supposed to revolutionize education? A virtually infinite landscape of refined, evocative, ever-improving titles have piled atop Pong in the last fifty years, intermingling with every other kind of entertainment media in an industry now bigger than Hollywood; why have game designers had such comparatively weak influence on the world of education? Is it possible that the thesis of educational gaming is wrong after all? We don't believe so.

**We the students contend that educational games fail to deliver because the incentives of this market sector contradict the very nature of what a game should be.** Educational institutions demand uniform instruction along a well-defined linear curriculum—and they want a randomized controlled longitudinal study to affirm that your product will yield a 3% bump in standardized test scores. Games are fundamentally voluntary pursuits, moresoe even than books or movies. The simple paradox of institutionally-mandated play undermines the most basic needs of an effective game.

Ironically, the best evidence for the value of educational games has come from the entertainment sector. Cultural phenoms like Minecraft and Kerbal Space Program conclusively prove that it is quite possible to learn deep technical skills from a game, *even when this is not a primary goal of any party involved.* In fact, it almost works *because* this is nobody's primary goal. The primary goal is play, and learning flows naturally from playing with a system like orbital mechanics or Redstone.

SineRider is built around play within mathematical systems. Specifically, we piggyback on a venerable tradition of mathematical play: the near-universal impulse for geeky teenagers to mess around with graphing calculators.
