Sinerider
===

Sinerider is a game about love and graphing, in development by teenagers at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com).

In it, you manipulate equations to create a curve that your player character can ride in order to progress through the levels!

## In a Time Long Ago

SineRider began its life as a Unity web game in 2014. It disappeared from the internet shortly thereafter, but was recently sighted by a roving gang of student hackers, ensnared in a lasso of fiendish construction, brought to heel, taught manners, groomed, and presented for your enjoyment.
