Sinerider
===
A game about love and graphing

Sinerider is a game we at [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com) have been working on for a couple months as of now (July 2022).

In it, you manipulate equations to create a curve that your player character can ride in order to progress through the levels!

Chris Walker, one of our amazing staff memebers at HQ, made an early version of this game 8 years ago (2015)!

As you can see from this old screen recording, the game has gotten a lot better!
